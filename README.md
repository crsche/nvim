# Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim config, I mainly use it for systems languages like Rust but it also works pretty for more complicated stuff like web dev.

## Installation

Clone the repository to `~/.config/nvim` (or wherever you put your Neovim configuration) and run `:Lazy` in Neovim.

## Plugins

Plugins can be found in `lua/plugins`.

## Note

- This configuration is based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and most keybinds can be found there.
